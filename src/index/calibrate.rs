//! Threshold calibration on labelled pairs.
//!
//! Design spec §4.4: a threshold is a **measurement on the user's own
//! data**, not a constant shipped in the crate. [`calibrate`] takes a
//! set of `(distance, is_match)` observations and returns the largest
//! distance that maximizes the profile's F-beta score, together with
//! the counts behind it, so the chosen threshold always carries its own
//! receipt.
//!
//! Two profiles exist because the cost of each error direction is not
//! symmetric:
//!
//! * [`Profile::Dedup`] — a false merge destroys an original the user
//!   cannot get back, while a missed duplicate only wastes storage.
//!   "Rather miss than over-merge" ⇒ precision-weighted **F0.5**, and
//!   among equal scores the *fewest* predicted matches.
//! * [`Profile::Search`] — a missed hit is a lost answer, while a false
//!   alarm only costs one `match()` call that rejects it. "Rather flag
//!   than miss" ⇒ recall-weighted **F2**, and among equal scores the
//!   *most* predicted matches.
//!
//! # Reproducibility
//!
//! The score is computed on counts, not floating accumulated weights,
//! every boundary is decided by integer comparisons, and the tie-break
//! is part of the contract: calling [`calibrate`] twice on the same
//! pairs returns the same [`Calibration`] — the plan's "running it
//! twice must give the same result" requirement.
